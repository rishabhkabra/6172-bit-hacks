1) Ben Bitdiddle's implementation: 49.579371s
2) Rotate via reversal implemention: 0.001699s --- 29181x
3) Reverse using character operations and bit hacks: 0.000320s --- 5.31x
4) Using unsigned long instead of char as the base word type for the bitarray buf: 0.000141s --- 2.27x (after bug fix)
5) Added lookup tables for bitmasks used in bitarray_reverse_on_steroids instead of using standard bit shifts: 0.000134s --- 1.05x
