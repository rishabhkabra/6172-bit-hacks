1) Ben Bitdiddle's implementation: 49.579371s
2) Rotate via reversal implemention: 0.001699s --- 29181x
3) Reverse using character operations and bit hacks: 0.000320s --- 5.31x
4) Using unsigned long instead of char as the base word type for the bitarray buf: 0.000089s --- 3.60x
5) Better implementation for reversing unsigned long values: 0.000018s --- 4.94x
